# trash-can
a bin to storage save emotional trash
the life in university is boring and sad.actually,i always feel a dramatical sense of alienation.although there is no mean to feel painful or guilty,i can't help getting rid of the bad emotion.All the things to me seems boring and less attractive
this problem doesn't happen right now,but long long ago,even my child time.
in other words,life itself to me is less attractive.i want to talk but can't or don't want to talk as well.it seems my essence is a contradiction.just like a coin with two sides, you shouldn't see both sides at the same time.but the fact is that
it happens,even right now.
a bad choice may cause many bad things,but when you make a choice,you don't know what will happen for your own choice,even it brings a lot of diasters and makes any people painful.
the life is always this.
i want to keep a balance,want to push my ship to the right path.
it impossible,when you feel that your life wound be better or tend to stable,the accidents happened.And all your efforts vanished,all your wanting became a joke or a dream.
how silly i am,all my life can't get rid of the loop.all things we purse become a unresonable dream.in chinese words,it means "天不遂人愿".
the objective world and these thins happened aren't under the control of our mind.Individuals is too small to compare with the times,just like a spindrift in a sea.
